0: file concatenation and combination and obtaining daily climatologies

1: defining a "shelf" for the west coast americas, averaging along that shelf  

2: applying time and wavenumber filters to isolate wave signal

3: performing an EOF and obtaining the leading modes that describe a wave

4: defining a "coastal wave index" and creating composites 

5: plotting composites
